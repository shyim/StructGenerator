# Struct Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shyim/StructGenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shyim/DatabaseEntitiesBuilder)

This package generates structs from a json file

## Why?

Working with API's is hard, where no structs exist. This package helps you to generate structs recursively for a json file, to have autocomplete.
